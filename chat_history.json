Here's the design vision and feature set for the first version:\n\n**Acknowledging the Request:**\n\nThis plan outlines the initial design and features for a barbershop app in Mexico, focusing on a user-friendly experience and relevant functionality.\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** A welcoming screen displaying featured barbers, services, and promotions. It should include a search bar for finding specific barbers or services.\n*   **Barber Profiles:** Detailed profiles for each barber, showcasing their expertise, services offered, customer reviews, and a gallery of their work.\n*   **Booking System:** An intuitive booking system allowing users to select a barber, service, date, and time. Confirmation and reminder notifications will be essential.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8F8` (Light gray, providing a clean backdrop)\n    *   Text: `#282828` (Dark gray, for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#6B7280` (Medium gray, for less important information)\n    *   Primary: `#A85532` (A warm brown, evoking a classic barbershop feel)\n    *   Secondary: `#E2DED0` (A light beige, complementing the brown)\n    *   Accent: `#D17842` (Burnt orange, for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White, for a clean, modern card appearance)\n    *   Highlight: `#FDE68A` (A soft yellow, for subtle emphasis)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use modern and clean fonts like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a professional and readable look. Ensure the font sizes are appropriate for mobile viewing.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Implement the home screen layout with a search bar, featured barbers, services, and promotions sections.\n    *   Design the featured barbers and services sections to display relevant information and images.\n    *   Add links to the barber profile pages.\n2.  **Create Barber Profile Screen:**\n    *   Create a new file for the barber profile screen (e.g., `app/barber/[id].tsx`).\n    *   Design the layout to display barber information, services, reviews, and a gallery.\n    *   Implement navigation to this screen from the home screen.\n3.  **Implement Booking System:**\n    *   Create a booking screen (e.g., `app/booking.tsx`).\n    *   Design the booking form to allow users to select barber, service, date, and time.\n    *   Implement basic confirmation and reminder functionality (can be expanded later with Supabase for persistent storage if the user enables it).\n4.  **Update Tab Bar:**\n    *   Modify the tab bar in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include relevant icons and labels for the new screens (Home, Barbers, Booking, Profile).\n5.  **Remove modal demos:**\n    *   Remove the modalDemos array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement this plan.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T23:14:23.020426"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a barbershop app for Mexico!
